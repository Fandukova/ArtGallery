                    <h2><em>The</em> Genre</h2>
                    <p>Surrealism is an artistic and cultural movement that emerged in Europe, following World War I. It
                        can be characterized by depicting uncommon imagery combined with ordinary everyday objects, in
                        order to create extravagant and illogical scenes. Surrealists were heavily influenced by the
                        Dada movement and by the work of Sigmund Freud, who stated in his theory of dreams and the
                        subconscious that “insanity was the breaking of the chains of logic”. The movement officially
                        started when French poet André Breton was in Paris and published the Surrealist manifesto on
                        October 24, 1924. This made Paris a focal point of the movement which grabbed the attention of
                        the whole world. <br><br><br></p>

                    <h2><em>The</em> Artist</h2>
                    <p>By far the most famous surrealist was the extravagant and bizarre Spanish artist, Salvador Dalí.
                        He often depicted a dream world where reality and surreality juxtaposed. In the background was
                        the ever-present bleak sunlit landscape that was inspired by his Catalan homeland. By far his
                        most famous piece of art is The Persistence of Memory (1921), which depicts melting clocks on
                        the aforementioned landscape. The main symbols of Dalí’s art were clocks, elephants, ants, eggs,
                        and snails. The melting clocks from 1921 symbolise time devouring itself and everything around
                        it. The exaggerated elephants, which carry immense weight on their backs, are usually depicted
                        with long and thin legs, and are a symbol of the future and strength. Not only was Salvador
                        Dalí’s art impressive, but so was his charm and grandeur, which made him into a worldwide
                        celebrity. </p>
